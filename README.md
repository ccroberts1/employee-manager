# Employee Manager

## Description

This project was to create a CLI tool which would help a user to manage a database of employees and managers along with related information like roles and salaries.

The Inquirer package is used to allow for interaction with the command line and the MYSQL2 package is used to communicate with the database.

In the future, I'd like to move the functions to a class to make the code cleaner as well as adding some remove/delete functionality and the ability to sum the salaries by department.
